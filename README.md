Or, to install any version:
1. Prepare a .gro, normally just by downloading a prerelase. You can also download the repo and run export.py (if python's installed)
2. In game go to extras -> workshop packages and disable randomizer, or just unsubscribe on the workshop
3. Navigate to [main talos install]\Content\Talos
4. Move the .gro there
5. Restart the game
6. Check that the version number on the back of the terminal is 9.0.0

To uninstall just re-enable/re-subscribe to the normal version, though eventually you should also delete the .gro
